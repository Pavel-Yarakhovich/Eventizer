# EVENTIZER

This is a pet project aims to help people to organize their events.

## Goals

Try new tools:

### MirageJS

Mock backend services with [MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/).

### NX

The project is suppossed to be set up as a monorepo. Try [NX](https://nx.dev/) for it.

### React Query

Use [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to automatically fetch, cache and update data.

## Desirable enhancements

### Use full power of TypeScript

The ultimate goal is to avoid using 'any' type at all.

### Don't use Redux store

Use a custom store instead. Build it with react hooks.

### Create nice UI building system

Use scss mixins, functions, etc. to create UI helper functions which automatically construct a page based on given parameters.
